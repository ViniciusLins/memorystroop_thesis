\chapter{Experiment}
\label{ch:experiment}

After presenting theoretical basis and the application's development in previous chapters, it is time to evaluate \textit{Memory Stroop} with specialists. A gamified application have to combine pleasant tasks and serious aims in order to turn practical but awful tasks more pleasant. This is the main topic of the experiment, that can be shown in every section of the present chapter. First it is presented the applied format of case study, after that the questionnaire, following it the results and finally discussion.

\section{The conduction of the experiment}

The quantitative and qualitative research does not involves data of children, only survey data about usability analysis measures. No personal information was collected and, because of this reason, there is no necessity of submission to University's Ethics Council. The questionnaire contains items about viability of gamification, simplicity/complexity of tasks and so on.
	
It has been performed with five computer science specialists, in May 2016. The general profile of the answerers involves people of both sex, at age of 25 to 32 years-old and with a professional background on mobile programming. There is no randomization or other advanced techniques in composing the sample: it is a common convenience sample. Data collection is made by a written survey shown  above. All sessions last 20 minutes, are monitored physically by the author, happens on the students' computer sciences laboratory and consist in three activities as it follows: the author's briefly explanation, the answerer's playing and finally the answerer's respond to the questionnaire. 

The identities (names and other personal information) of specialists are	 protected by identification numbers (IDs) on questionnaires in order to avoid over-exposition. For each automated monitored playing, the respective ID of the user is stored in the header of common data. In this way, it is possible to track each monitored playing outcomes with the child without employing its name or other specific data. The collected data offer three utilities: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Validate the implementation with experiment evaluators;
\item Verify the gamification effectiveness;
\item Collect information for improve the application in newer versions.
\end{enumerate} 


\section{Heuristics and usability evaluation}

This questionnaire is derived from some questions proposed by \cite{Song2007} in its game-playing heuristics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item                        Is the visual feedback, such as their status/score, and visual cue clearly presented?
\item                        Is the audio feedback, such as the audio cue adequately provided?
\item                        Does it help that interactions with other characters or targets are analogous or similar to real-world situations?
\item                        Do you feel in control of the actions occurring on the screen?
\item                        Are consistent Names/Information/Structure/ Representation being provided?
\item                        Are instructions for the system retrievable within the game?
\item                        Is help needed to engage in game play displayed through a tutorial?
\item                        Is it easy to learn at the beginning of the game?
\item                        Is it hard to master the game?
\item                        Is the play between gamers fair?
\item                        Are the outcomes of the game not predictable?
\item                        Does it provide variable difficulty levels that are suited to all levels of gamers?
\end{enumerate}

\texttt{%\section{A Case Study Approach and Implications}
%
%The case study proposed here is based on a survey of usability analysis features to check and improve the gamified applications.Therefore the method chosen to that development is the case study. Some authors emphasize usability is a diffuse parameter of software quality that treats not only the comprehensiveness of the user interface, as well as the learnability, efficiency, reliability and satisfaction \citep{Folmer2005}. Generally, final user does not know how to measure each one of those  components. That is why usability analysis is performed with specialists, as in the present study. Doolin states that the case study is a powerful tool of analysis of software production \citep{Lauri-2011}. It could, but the same authors employ the qualitative approach, because it promotes fast answers without the necessity of tabulation or other statistical that may cost high computational processing, monetary investment and time. 
%
%\section{Description of the Present Case Study}
%
%\subsection{Questionnaire and Comparative Approach}
%
%All questions are derived from Villa's previous research for its own application called `Colors' \citep{Villa}, and its results are compared with present experiments' results to compare usability patterns between the two application. Additionally, Villa's experiment involved more people, 10 specialists and the same number of two other groups (psychologists and children) that are not consulted in this research by reason of lack of enough time to perform evaluation with them. The comparison is made involving the group of computer scientists of each research. The proposed questionnaire has 11 questions. The same questions of both experiments are shown bellow.

%\section{Results}
%In this section it is presented the questions, results and their percentages on charts. From the first to the seventh, there are five options: `totally disagree', `disagree', `no position', `agree' and `totally agree'. On charts, each of these options are respectively indicated by numbers 1 to 5 on the horizontal axis. Questions 8 and 9 have only `yes' or `no' represented naturally as 1 or 2 on its charts. Questions 10 (optional) and 11 are subjective. Results  of two applications are briefly compared.
%
%\subsubsection{Question One}
%
%The first question (``The progressiveness of difficult is adequate.'') aims to check if the progression of difficult is playable. On \textit{Memory Stroop} results, the majority of answers express that it is really adequate. As the report below shows, it can be seen the absence of totally disagreement. The results are extensively close to Villa's Colors results \citep{Villa}, although there is a higher score for \textit{Colors} evaluation.

%\subsubsection{Question Two}
%
%The second question (``It is possible to understand the game rules.'') is related to understanding of game rules majority. By the same results of previous question the answers express that learneability of game rules are totally adequate. There is higher scores for \textit{Colors} upon  \textit{Memory Stroop} (70 \% for option `totally agree' upon 60 \%).

%\subsubsection{Question Three}

%In the third topic of the survey (``The game is not functional, it is slow.''), the topic talks about the efficiency/slowly of the game. The results of the present application are real next to Villa's counterparts in this specific measure only in position, but Villa's best score, 70\% at `totally disagree' is only 10\% higher than \textit{Memory Stroop} equivalent.

%
%\section{Discussion}
%In questions 1, 2 and 3 previous Villa's application has presented higher scores on the most relevant option, meanwhile in the questions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8  \textit{Memory Stroop} scores' has reveled best results. This shows that \textit{Colors} is a best tool in some aspects, like in progressiveness of difficult, the understanding of rule and about the functional character of the game. Other questions show best results for \textit{Memory Stroop} like screen sequence and positioning of objects on screen. But the most relevant advantage of \textit{Memory Stroop} upon \textit{Colors}  is the greater satisfaction about gamification proposal in the former. This suggests that it is positive that \textit{Memory Stroop} implements an evolution of research to a game without negative stimuli and centered on working memory with a simple memory game combined to Stroop test tasks.
}
\section{Summary}

In order to verify the proposed application's viability and core usability facets, it was performed a case study survey with computer science specialists that work on mobile programming. Only functional aspects were evaluated by a survey involving these specialists. That shows an evolution on gamification and other functional and non-functional in the current version of the project.
